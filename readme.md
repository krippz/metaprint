# Metaprint

Tired of clicking up the Explorer meta data?

Want to check each file in a folder for stuff like copyright or just to see what version a file has?

This little dotnet tool has you coverd.

## Installation

You will need tho have the dotnet sdk installed, you can get it here [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)

Since this runs as a dotnet tool the full SDK is needed.

run the following command to set it up:

```sh
dotnet tool install metaprint -g
```

this will install it as a global tool which you can later invoke by

```Powershell
metaprint --help
```
